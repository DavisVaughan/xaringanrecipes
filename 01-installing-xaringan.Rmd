# Installing xaringan

## Problem

You want to install the `xaringan` package.

## Companion Deck

None

## Solution

Great! You have two options, install from CRAN to get the stable version,
or from GitHub to get the development version.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("xaringan")

devtools::install_github("yihui/xaringan")
```

## Discussion

This book will use the CRAN version. Specifically version `0.6`.
