# Creating a slide

## Problem

You want to create a slide in `xaringan`.

## Companion Deck

[slides](http://xaringan-field-guide-companion.davisvaughan.com/03-creating-a-slide/creating-a-slide.html#1)

## Solution

In `xaringan`, your entire presentation is created using 1 RMarkdown file. 

* Slides are separated with a triple dash, `---`. The triple dash represents the beginning of a slide.

* You can write plain text between two sets of `---` and have it show up as text
on the slide.

The chunk below demonstrates how to create a slide, and add some text.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
---

Hello reader

---
```
 
## Discussion

There are two extra caveats here. 

1) A title slide is automatically generated for you from the YAML header. This
is the first chunk of information that you should see in the template. It should
start with `title:`.

2) For the first slide after the title slide, you do not need to add a `---` to 
get it to render. It is already provided for you by the YAML header. The 
companion example for this lesson provides the following snippet to demonstrate this:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
