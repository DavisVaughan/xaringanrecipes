## Problem

You want to add executable R code to a slide.

## Solution

Just like with RMarkdown/Notebooks, you can add executable R code with chunks. While on a slide,
just add a chunk like you would with RMarkdown, and type the code that you want to execute.

Here is some R code

```{r}`r ''`
1 + 1
```

````

This will render both the R code AND the output. We can use this to programmatically
generate images in our slides. By setting `echo=FALSE`, only the image is shown
on the slide.
