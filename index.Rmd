# Preface {-}

[`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) is a powerful slide editor package built by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui),
a software engineer at RStudio. While the defaults he sets are incredibly well 
thought out, most of us can't resist wanting to tweak our slides in every way
imaginable. This book, inspired by [Bob Rudis](https://twitter.com/hrbrmstr)'s 
[_21 Recipes for Mining Twitter with rtweet_](https://rud.is/books/21-recipes/index.html),
is here to serve the purpose of providing solutions to some of the most common
tweaks that you might want to perform. This will in no way be an exhaustive list,
but hopefully can get new users to `xaringan` up and running quickly.
